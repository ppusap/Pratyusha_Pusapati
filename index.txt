I am currently a first-semester graduate student at Northwest Missouri State University working on my Masters of Applied computer science. I should be graduating in fall 2020.

I'm from vizag, India. I completed my under graduation in electronics and communication department from LENDI INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY. I also worked for TCS for 1.5 years as a back end developer in an application system called TPF( Transaction Processing Facility) which is an IBM real-time operating system. My hobbies are playing Badminton and Gardening.

Soon after my graduation, I want to see myself as a full stack developer working for a top MNC. But my ultimate goal is to an entrepreneur.

My Interests are playing Badminton,travelling and learning new technologies.
